  <h1>STAY TOGETHER: FOR YOU AND THE PLANET</h1>
  <p>By pioneering the launch of disposable sanitary pads, LivFree More® helped women change their habits and brought them the option of feeling comfortable during their period. This freedom has empowered women over generations, but it has also brought the responsibility to take care of the planet so that future generations of women can also continue to progress. LivFree More® is always evolving in the development of its products to support women's progress and the care for the planet, whether in the rigorous choice of raw materials for our products, in the development of more sustainable solutions or in supporting social causes.</p>
  <h1>MADE WITH MORE THAN 75% RENEWABLE SOURCE MATERIALS</h1>
  <p>To ensure your health and your safety, LivFree More® products undergo an extensive, robust, and judicious process for evaluation, starting from choosing the raw material until the final product. LivFree More® thick pads are made with about 75% renewable source materials in line with our sustainability roadmap.
  </p>
  <h1>PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
  <p>LivFree More® being an environmentally responsible brand has always adhered to effective plastic waste management guidelines. When the Central Pollution Control Board regulation mandated all plastic to be at 50 micron, LivFree More® changed its packaging from 35 micron to 54 micron to facilitate better segregation at the rag pickers end and to get plastic back into the recycling fold. This transition began in June 2019 and as of Jan 2020, all LivFree More® sanitary pads packaging plastic has moved to 54 micron.</p>
  <h1>EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY (EPR)</h1>
  <p>Being a responsible corporate citizen LivFree More® has ensured adherence to EPR guidelines

    LivFree More® is committed to getting 100% of its total post-consumer waste to be recycled in FY 20-21. In FY 19-20, 70% of the post-consumer waste generated from LivFree More® sanitary pads has been recycled.

  <h1>SUPPORT FOR WOMEN'S PROGRESS</h1>
  <p>
    Taboos, lack of information and access to sanitary napkins are just some of the reasons why menstruation still limits the lives of women in many places. LivFree More® believes that together we can make a difference and for that is leading a series of initiatives to transform the reality of those who need it most. Key initiatives driven through external partnerships include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          1. “It’s Just a Period” Campaign: About 15 million girls enter the menarche cycle every year in India, yet more than 71% of them have no knowledge of menstruation before their periods. LivFree More® has always strived to normalize periods for women across the nation and feels that making the girl period ready will not suffice and wants to push the envelope and rather build a society that is period ready where the girl feels absolutely normal having her periods. For this apart from media campaigns on this narrative, LivFree More® is also partnering with other organizations to further this cause. Encouraging families to be supportive of the girls during their periods, LivFree More® also had a clear call to action to Menstrupedia content on normalizing periods
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Partnering with Menstrupedia to disseminate menstrual education: LivFree More® truly wants to be an enabler for family members to have the conversation. LivFree More® understands that the period conversation is not an easy one, and so just highlighting the need to talk will not make people talk about this to the girl. LivFree More® via Menstrupedia will be sharing self-help guides for family members wanting to talk about this but did not know how to. This guide in a comic book format covers various softer aspects like choosing the right time to talk, how to prepare for the conversation, how to create a menstruation friendly environment for the daughter etc. More than 15000 comic books on menstrual education have been distributed in 3 months since the initiation of this partnership in June 2020
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Collaborating with UNICEF to drive menstrual management with dignity: Through this collaboration, LivFree More® wants to strengthen its brand purpose of enabling young girls have a healthy relationship with periods by participating in UNICEF led activities on MHM (menstrual hygiene management). This partnership has managed to reach out to 460000 adolescent girls in Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat. More than 10,000 front line workers and 60,000 women from self help groups have been trained and sensitized in subject. 525 wardens of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidhyalaya and 315 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM’s) have been trained.
